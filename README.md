# accounts-rails-reactjs

This is a simple register to keep track of debits and credits.  Just a little sample app I found here:  https://www.airpair.com/reactjs/posts/reactjs-a-guide-for-rails-developers

Simply git clone this repo, do a bundle install, run "rake db:create db:migrate" and then connect to http://localhost:3000/records.
